# 🧠 Python-Fundamentals-Capstone-Project



## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies core Python, NumPy, and Pandas skills to analyze a dataset involving employee project performance, designation levels, and project cost analysis. The tasks focus on data cleaning, transformation, joining, conditional logic, and summarization—essential for real-world data science workflows.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **NumPy** – for numerical operations

## 📁 Files Included

* `Untitled-checkpoint.ipynb`: Python notebook with completed code and outputs
* `Capstone project - Python Fundamentals.pdf`: Problem statement and dataset description

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The project uses three datasets:

1. **Employee Data** – ID, name, gender, city, age
2. **Seniority Level Data** – ID and designation level
3. **Project Data** – ID, project name, cost, and status

Each ID represents an employee who leads multiple projects.

## ✅ Tasks Performed

| Task No. | Description                                                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Created 3 DataFrames and saved them as `.csv` files                           |
| **2**    | Replaced missing project costs using a running average with a loop            |
| **3**    | Split the `name` column into `First Name` and `Last Name`                     |
| **4**    | Merged all three DataFrames into one final DataFrame                          |
| **5**    | Added a bonus column (5% of project cost) for finished projects               |
| **6**    | Demoted designation level for failed project leads; removed ineligible ones   |
| **7**    | Prefixed names with "Mr." or "Mrs." based on gender and dropped gender column |
| **8**    | Promoted designation for employees over 29 years old                          |
| **9**    | Computed total project cost per employee and stored in a new DataFrame        |
| **10**   | Printed employee details where the city name contains the letter "o"          |
